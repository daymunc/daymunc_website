## DAYMUNC Staff Information

### Message from the Secretary General
Hello, my name is Samantha Hall and I am the Secretary General for DAYMUNC XXIII.
I am currently a senior at Wright State University, majoring in International Studies with a focus in Diplomacy and Peace, and minoring in Political Science.
I have been involved in Model UN for 3 years now, and have participated in both DAYMUNC and NMUN in the past.
It is a honor to be Secretary General for DAYMUNC and my goal for DAYMUNC XXIII is to make it an enjoyable conference, where all delegates can learn from each other and the conference itself.
Currently, DAYMUNC XXIII is still in its early stages, thus I am open to any suggestions on improving the site or the conference itself.
If you have any questions, comments, and concerns, please contact me at the new Secretary General email address that is located in the Contact Us section. Thank you and I look forward to working with all of you!

### About the Staff
Our staff consists of faculty, staff, students, and volunteers from universities and offices located in the greater Dayton region.
DAYMUNC Staff members are appointed by the DAYMUNC Faculty Directors and the DAYMUNC Secretary General.

If you are interested in working as staff for DAYMUNC, please contact the Secretary General at {{< variables sg_email >}} for more information.

We try to emulate the rules and practices of NMUN.
DAYMUNC is above all a learning conference - we are here to have fun, learn something about international affairs and UN procedure, and to meet and socialize with students from other schools.
It is not a teaching conference - delegates are guided, but not directed; we welcome students and adult groups from all levels of preparation and experience; everyone's opinion is equally valued.
