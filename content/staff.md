## DAYMUNC Staff Information

***

### Message from the Secretary General

Hello! My name is Autumn Kern and I am the Secretary General for DAYMUNC 2020. I completed my undergraduate degree in Political Science and International Studies from Wright State University. I am currently a Master of Art in International and Comparative Politics student at the Wright State Graduate School, where I am studying the involvement of women in militant Islamic groups. 

2020 marks my fourth year of Model UN participation. I have thoroughly enjoyed participating in the program both at DAYMUNC and at NMUN, and appreciate the knowledge I have gained from acting as a delegate on multiple committees- with Security Council being my favorite! I am especially passionate about cyber security, weapons of mass destruction, migration, women's rights, and the Middle East. 

When I'm not busy with MUN related tasks, I enjoy reading, hiking, and baking. The Model UN program has been instrumental in shaping who I am as a person, and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to lead this conference. It is my hope that every student in attendance leaves DAYMUNC 2020 as a stronger, more confident delegate, with an enthusiasm not only for Model UN, but to make a different in the world.

We try to emulate the rules and practices of NMUN. DAYMUNC is above all a learning conference - we are here to have fun, learn about international affairs and UN procedure, and to meet and socialize with students from other schools. It is not a teaching conference - delegates are guided, but not directed; we welcome students and adult groups from all levels of preparation and experience; everyone's opinion is equally valued.
