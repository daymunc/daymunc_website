## DAYMUNC Staff Information

---

### Message from the Secretary General

Hello, my name is Nickii Webb and I am the Secretary General for the 25th Annual Dayton Model UN Conference in Feb. 2018. I am currently a Masters of Art in International and Comparative Politics student at Wright State University, studying rehabilitation programs for children affected by armed conflict and their role in post-conflict state stability. This will be my fourth year of Model UN experience, but my first year staffing. It is my hope that we will work together to make this the best conference yet to honor those who have come before us. 

DAYMUNC is meant to be a learning conference for all interested in pursuing knowledge on international affairs and to that end, we work to understand our role in the world around us. I hope that you come to the conference with an open mind and leave with the desire to never stop discovering new ideas from others. Welcome to the 2018 DAYMUNC!

### About the Staff

DAYMUNC Staff members are appointed by the DAYMUNC Faculty Directors and the DAYMUNC Secretary General.

We try to emulate the rules and practices of NMUN.
DAYMUNC is above all a learning conference - we are here to have fun, learn something about international affairs and UN procedure, and to meet and socialize with students from other schools.
It is not a teaching conference - delegates are guided, but not directed; we welcome students and adult groups from all levels of preparation and experience; everyone's opinion is equally valued.
