## Attendance Information

***

If you are interested in attending DAYMUNC {{< 2020>}}, email the Secretary General at secgen.daymunc@gmail.com.

### DAYMUNC registration fee:

PAYMENT OF DAYMUNC DELEGATE FEES:  
The payment fee per delegate is $45. However, if this is your first time attending the conference, we are offering a discount rate of $35 per delegate. The option for payment of DAYMUNC Delegate fees is the same as last year.  Below are the following instructions by Sinclair Community College’s (SCC) Office of the Bursar on how payments are to be made:  
Sinclair requires payment of deposits or full delegate payments directly to the College Bursar’s office and John Coyle assists us with this process.  If you have any questions about payment of DAYMUNC Delegate fees, you may contact Mr. Coyle at [937-512-5343](tel:937-512-5343). There is a website where you can pay by credit card (see link below). If you want to pay in by check, the memo line on your check should read Model UN and the check should be mailed to: Bursar, Sinclair Community College, 444 West Third Street, Dayton 45402-1460. Alternatively, you can bring a check or credit card to registration on the morning of February 7th; a representative from the Bursar will be there to take payments (at 8:00 a.m.).

Online payment is at:

A 10% nonrefundable deposit is necessary to guarantee your country assignments. This deposit is due by December 14, 2019 using the above payment methods. However, if your school is unable to provide the required deposit, please feel free to contact the Co-Directors at kathleen.sooy@sinclair.edu and jennifer.sooy@sinclair.edu to discuss options. 

If you have any problems making payment through SCC Bursar’s website, we recommend you bring your check or credit card to registration on February 7, 2020 or mailing a check to the Bursar.
