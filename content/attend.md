## DAYMUNC registration fee:
Below are the following instructions by Sinclair Community College’s (SCC) Office of the Bursar on how payments are to be made:

> Sinclair requires payment of deposits or full delegate payments directly to the College Bursar’s office and John Coyle assists us with this process.
> If you have any questions about payment of DAYMUNC Delegate fees, you may contact Mr. Coyle at 937-512-5343.
> There is a website where you can pay by credit card (see link below). If you want to pay in by check, the memo line on
> your check should read Model UN and the check should be mailed to: Bursar, Sinclair Community College, 444 West Third Street,
> Dayton 45402-1460. Alternatively, you can bring a check or credit card to registration on the morning of February 3rd;
a representative from the Bursar will be there to take payments (at 8:00 a.m.).

## Make your payments via the [Sinclair Community College Bursar's Office](https://www.officialpayments.com/pc_template_standard.jsp?JSESSIONID=lDQlSx2SlTRnQzL!764784730!910004141&body=pc_step2_body.jsp.").
A deposit is necessary to guarantee your country assignments. If you have any problems making payment through
SCC Bursar’s website, we recommend you bring your check or credit card to registration on February 3, 2017 or mailing a
check to the Bursar.

## A note on registration and country assignments:
In keeping with past practice, we will try to make sure that everyone who wants one gets a Security Council country;
since we normally have many schools in attendance, this means that initially, we will assign each school no more than
one SC member. However, as time goes on and SC members have not been spoken for, we will start assigning more than one
to schools who want them. Members of the Security Council need four delegates to cover each committee; non-members
require three. One delegate per country per committee, please - we discourage doubling up.
