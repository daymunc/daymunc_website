***

Committee Topics: Although there is no background guide, focus the bulk of your research on recent events and relations in Pacific Asia.

The following articles are being provided to support your preparations for the DAYMUNC simulation. Although no one of these articles should be considered indicative of the situations you will confront, your cognizance of the international rules and norms (or lack thereof) that currently or could one day play a role in each will assist you throughout the simulation.
